# My personal dotfiles

- [ ] add nice look, colors in terminal and logos
- [ ] make it more error resistent, so it wouldn't stop, but try to continue
- [ ] make your decisions on the beggining, no input after, config saved into file, then runned
    - [ ] create a script before sync, which will ask user for all settings, saved all what can be done after into json file (you can also use your json to skip questions, then do everything what should be done before sync, and things with prompts, sync files, then run all things from json (using jq) file)
- [x] cleanup after installation
- [x] NVChad should be installed before sync -> add it into other script
- [x] sudo
- [ ] pick from 4 categories minimal.lst basic.lst full.lst or custom.lst (pick for each category)
- [ ] fix nvim/NVChad config to load
- [ ] wallpapers are big, load them only if user agreed so
